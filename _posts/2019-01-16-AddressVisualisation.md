I volunteer for a charity based in Peshawar Pakistan, called [Abaseen 
Institute for Medical Sciences](http://aimspk.abaseen.com) - AIMS. This 
is a charity that strives to create a quality assured and affordable 
diabetes healthcare institute. I am involved in the IT-based activities, 
which gave me access to the hospital's data. 

The hospital has agreed with the local government to run bi-monthly medical 
camps throughout the city of Peshawar. The city can be split into Union 
Councils, of which there are 92. By analysing where our patients live, we can 
strategically choose which Union councils of the city to visit first, to 
maximise the number of patients visiting from that region.
